# eco_writing_shiny_template

Here is a sample template to help you get started on a Shiny app.

The ui.R file controls what the app looks like, and the server.R file controls what the app does.

Put the data you want to use in the data/ sub directory.

To run the app, you should see a "Run App" button at the top of your RStudio window (in the same row as all the tabs for the files you have open). Alternatively if you have set your working directory to the `eco_writing_shiny_template` folder you can run `runApp("Eco_Writing_Shiny_Template/")` in the console.
